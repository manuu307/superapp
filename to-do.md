Act as a Senior Full-Stack Engineer. I need to integrate a scalable Video Calling feature into my existing SuperApp.CURRENT STACKBackend: Node.js (Express)Frontend: Next.js (React)Infrastructure: Docker Compose with Nginx, Redis, and MongoDBService Discovery: Docker network 'chat-net'OBJECTIVEImplement a scalable video conferencing solution using LiveKit (SFU architecture).TASKSINFRASTRUCTURE (docker-compose.yml):Add a 'livekit' service using 'livekit/livekit-server:latest'.Configure it to use the 'chat-net' network.Expose port 7880 (API) and the UDP range 50000-60000 for media.Create a 'livekit.yaml' config file template with API Key/Secret placeholders.BACKEND TOKEN SERVICE (Node.js):Create an API route in the existing Node.js server (server/index.js) at 'POST /api/video/token'.Use 'livekit-server-sdk' to generate an Access Token.The route should accept 'roomName' and 'participantName' from the request body.Implement security: ensure the user is authenticated (via session/JWT) before issuing a token.FRONTEND UI (Next.js):Create a new component 'VideoConferenceRoom.jsx' using '@livekit/components-react'.Implement a 'Join Call' interface that triggers the token request.Use the 'LiveKitRoom' and 'VideoConference' components to handle the media layout.Include a 'Leave' button that cleans up the connection.INTEGRATION:Add a 'Start Video Call' button to the existing 'ChatInterface.tsx'.When clicked, it should navigate to the video room or open a modal with the video conference.CONSTRAINTSThe solution must be scalable via SFU (no Peer-to-Peer bottlenecks).Must handle mobile responsiveness for users on data plans (Simulcast).All communication between Next.js and LiveKit must be authenticated via the Node.js backend.
